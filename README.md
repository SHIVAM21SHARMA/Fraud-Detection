# Fraud-Detection
Detection of Frauds on Credit Card Returns using Machine Learning.
In this project, I am showing you that, using machine learning, how you can detect  frauds on credit card transactions. In this project , i used various machine learning models 
like Logistic Regression, KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour), SVM (Support Vector Machine),etc. that help me to further calculate its accuracy and f1 score for the success of my project.
As dataset is very large , so visualising it in graphical form is quite complex and need further more information to visualise it. Hence, its also fine to visualise the result in
the form of confusion matrix, by f1 score and accuracy.
Dataset Source is from Kaggel.
